Datasets used :
We have collected the datasets from the NHANES website and downloaded the datasets
from body mass index, food codes, foods, modification codes, nutrient intakes, 
demographic values and sample weights from the year 2007-2018. All the datasets 
are in .xpt format. We need to convert the datasets into csv format using SAS 
universal reader viewer. we need to form a dataset by merging all the individual 
datasets using concat operation.
